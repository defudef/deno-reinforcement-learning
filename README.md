## Written on Tensorflow.js

This is an example of Reinforcement learning running in Deno. Written on top of the tfjs.
Just a create (`o`) trying to reach the goal (`E`)

## Install Deno 2

```
https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/
```

## Install dependencies

```
deno install
```

## Run training

```
deno run train
```

## Enjoy!
And observe how this tiny creature is trying to reach the goal

## TODO:
- add environment variables for hyper parameters
- save and load models
- implement Replay Buffer for better performance
- add more scenarios: mazes, deadly obstacles, enemies, multiple agents
